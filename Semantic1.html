            <h1>A short paragraph about Learning.</h1>
            <p>
                Learning is a continuous journey of growth, discovery, and transformation. 
                It involves not only acquiring new knowledge or skills but also developing the 
                ability to think critically, adapt to change, and apply understanding in real-world 
                contexts. True learning goes beyond memorization—it challenges assumptions, sparks 
                curiosity, and encourages a deeper connection with the world around us. Whether 
                through formal education, hands-on experience, or self-exploration, learning empowers 
                individuals to unlock their potential, overcome limitations, and contribute meaningfully 
                to their communities and goals.

            <h2>Why do we need to learn throughout our life?</h2>
            <p>
                Learning is not a destination but a lifelong process that shapes who we are and who we become. 
                It teaches us resilience through failure, clarity through confusion, and confidence through 
                persistence. Every new concept mastered, every mistake corrected, and every challenge overcome 
                adds to a foundation that prepares us for the future. In a world thats constantly evolving, 
                the willingness to learn—unlearn, and relearn—is one of the most powerful tools we can possess. 
                Embracing learning with an open mind turns every experience into an opportunity for growth.

            <h3>Machine learning</h3>
            <p>
                Machine learning, a branch of artificial intelligence, concerns the construction and study of 
                systems that can learn from data. For example, a machine learning system could be trained on 
                email messages to learn to distinguish between spam and non-spam messages. Most of the Machine 
                Learning models are based on probabilistic theories where each input (e.g. an image ) is 
                associated with a probability to become the desired output.
